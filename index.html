        <p>“Before I started the Koda School I had literally ZERO programming experience. After almost exactly a year of working through the program, I was offered a job as a front end web developer.Koda School taught me all the most crucial skills in webdev and gave me an incredibly strong foundation for branching out and learning other pieces of the web-dev puzzle along the way.”</p>

        <p>“I remember when I first tried to learn to code. It's not an accident that I say I tried because if I'm honest, I started a few times before finally sticking to it. I tried many different resources, courses, and curriculums, but none of them seemed to teach in a way that made me stick to it. What differentiates Koda School from all those other courses and curriculums out there is its unique way of providing guidance and answers to the most important questions, while also strengthening your ability to push through the curriculum and projects by yourself and as a result grow on your struggles. ”</p>

        <p>“Before I found Koda School I had very little direction with my learning, jumping from topic to topic then trying to piece things together as I went. Having this online curriculum to follow was a massive help and took my understanding of programming to the next level. Being self taught and going into a job interview with no professional experience is incredibly daunting, but being able to point to my GitHub which had all of the projects I'd completed while going through the curriculum, I was able to demonstrate that I was committed to learning and improving myself, ultimately that’s exactly what they were after in an employee. ”</p>

              Paths are structured curriculum roadmaps that show you exactly where to start and what to learn next. 
              We have Career Paths that teach the core skills of Computer Science, Data Science, and Web Development, as well as Skill Paths focused on more specialized, shorter-term goals.
              If you’re not sure where to start, we have a path for that too.
